## The Project

Just a simple bot written in Python posting on Twitter daily updates of the situation concerning Covid-19 in Italy.  
The bot is currently under development and running on a server, periodically checking for updates.  
The Twitter account currently used is [@covid_daily](https://twitter.com/covid_daily).  

## Charts Explanation

Here's a small explanation of the chart generated by the bot.
- A chart that shows the number of active cases, the number of deaths and the number of recoveries
- A chart that shows how many people of the infected are using ICU's (intensive care units), how many are just hospitalized and how many are just home-quarantined
- A chart that shows the number of daily tests executed and how many new infected people are registered each day
- A chart that shows the daily number of new infected, new deaths, and new recoveries.

I might add more charts in the future, if you have some ideas let me know.

## Data

All the data used by the bot are from [the Italian's official repository of Protezione Civile](https://github.com/pcm-dpc/COVID-19) that is daily updated.
